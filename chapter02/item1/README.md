## Item 1: Consider static factory methods instead of constructors

Static factory methods and public constructors both have their uses,
and it pays to understand their relative merits. Often static factories are preferable,
so avoid the reflex to provide public constructors without first considering static factories.

Here are some common names for static factory methods.
This list is far from exhaustive:

- **`from`** — A type-conversion method that takes a single parameter and returns a corresponding instance of this type, for example:

    ```java
    Date d = Date.from(instant);
    ```

- **`of`** — An aggregation method that takes multiple parameters and returns an instance of this type that incorporates them,
for example:

    ```java
    Set<Rank> faceCards = EnumSet.of(JACK, QUEEN, KING);
    ```
    
- **`valueOf`** — A more verbose alternative to from and of, for example:

    ```java
    BigInteger prime = BigInteger.valueOf(Integer.MAX_VALUE);
    ```
    
- **`instance`** or **`getInstance`** — Returns an instance that is described by its parameters (if any) but cannot be said to have the same value, for example:

    ```java
    StackWalker luke = StackWalker.getInstance(options);
    ```
    
- **`create`** or **`newInstance`** — Like instance or getInstance, except that the method guarantees that each call returns a new instance, for example:

    ```java
    Object newArray = Array.newInstance(classObject, arrayLen);
    ```

- **`getType`** — Like getInstance, but used if the factory method is in a different class.
Type is the type of object returned by the factory method, for example:

    ```java
    FileStore fs = Files.getFileStore(path);
    ```

- **`newType`** — Like newInstance, but used if the factory method is in a different class. Type is the type of object returned by the factory method, for example:

    ```java
    BufferedReader br = Files.newBufferedReader(path);
    ```
  
- **`type`** — A concise alternative to getType and newType, for example:

    ```java
    List<Complaint> litany = Collections.list(legacyLitany);
    ```
